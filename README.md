# Dash Microbiome
This is a repo to demonstrate how to build a Dash app in R for microbiome data. It is under development and therefore not yet deployed on a server. This app in particular makes use of common packages for microbiome analysis including `phyloseq`, `microbiome`, `picante`, 

## Running an app
You will need to run applications from the root directory of the repository. e.g., if the name of the app you want to run is my_dash_app and the app filename is
app.R, you would need to run RScript `apps/my_dash_app/app.R` from the root of the repository. Alternatively you can run an app from within RStudio using Source. For more info on developing Dash apps in R: https://dashr.plotly.com/

The assets folder contains the CSS styling of the app and header.
